# Reverse Proxy ðŸš€

*An over-engineered Reverse-proxy implementation using `FastAPI` for the backend, `Redis` for the static-page caching, `gunicorn` and `uvicorn` to serve a uvloop-enabled multi-worker architecture, packaged using `Poetry`, written in Python with love.*

## Requirements

- A server (UNIX support only due to `gunicorn`)
- Python 3.10+ (Usage of built-in unions instead from `typing` module)
- Poetry for Python (Handling dependencies and running the server)
- Redis Instance (**Optional**)

## Installation

The installation process is handled effortlessly with Poetry.

To install Poetry, follow https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

Once Poetry is installed:

- **Optional**: Initialize a virtual environment to install and run the dependencies
```properties
poetry shell
```

- Install all dependencies (`poetry.lock` is present in the repository to make sure the versions we install are the same)
```properties
poetry install
```

- That's it!

## Run
- First, edit the .env file properly and set the `REDIS_URL` variable. If you don't want to host your own Redis instance, you can create a free instance from [Railway](https://railway.app)

```properties
mv .env.sample .env
```

- Run the app using Poetry (python3 instead of python, depending on your system)
```properties
poetry run python reverse-proxy
```

- Or without it 
```properties
python reverse-proxy
```
## Usage
>By default, the proxy doesn't run as a daemon

- Using Screen
Run the proxy inside a UNIX Screen, so that you can let it run in the background.

- Using systemd service
Coming Soon!

- Inside a docker container
Coming Soon!

## Advanced
To run it as a daemon, add:
```json
"daemon": "True"
```
in `options` dict in `reverse-proxy/__main__.py:main`

> This repo might look like a reverse-proxy for a particular web address, but it is to show an example of how different end-points which may return different type of responses should be handled.

> To better understand how Redis caching can be enabled/used for certain end-points, please refer to the implementation of the `/help` end-point

## Future plans
- Dockerize for OS-agnostic run
- Improve how the number of workers is set
- Make a non-Redis version/Redis decorator with a bool switch
