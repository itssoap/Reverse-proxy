# Reverse Proxy ðŸš€

*An over-engineered Reverse-proxy implementation using `FastAPI` for the backend, `Redis` for the static-page caching, `gunicorn` and `uvicorn` to serve a uvloop-enabled multi-worker architecture, packaged using `Poetry`, written in Python with love.*

## Requirements

- A server (UNIX support only due to `gunicorn`)
- Python 3.10+ (Usage of built-in unions instead from `typing` module)
- Poetry for Python (Handling dependencies and running the server)
- Redis Instance (**Optional**)
- Docker and docker-compose (**Optional**)

## Installation

The first step:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itssoap/Reverse-proxy.git && cd Reverse-proxy
```

### Poetry

The installation process is handled effortlessly with Poetry.

To install Poetry, follow https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

Once Poetry is installed:

- **Optional**: Initialize a virtual environment to install and run the dependencies
```properties
poetry shell
```

- Install all dependencies (`poetry.lock` is present in the repository to make sure the versions we install are the same)
```properties
poetry install
```

- That's it!\

### Docker!

![Installation Instructions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6275744/230888549-3ff2aac7-4f52-4939-9520-a20a9d638b8e.png)


I use docker-compose for installation (root or non-root, depends on your mileage). The Dockerfile has been made for zero-configuration by default, and also initiates Redis on its own. Based on your usage, remove Redis if unnecessary.

```properties
docker-compose up -d
```

## Run
> Only required if you are not using Docker or you have a custom Redis instance.
- First, edit the .env file properly and set the `REDIS_URL` variable. If you don't want to host your own Redis instance, you can create a free instance from [Railway](https://railway.app)

```properties
mv .env.sample .env
```

- Run the app using Poetry (python3 instead of python, depending on your system)
```properties
poetry run python reverse-proxy
```

- Or without it 
```properties
python reverse-proxy
```
## Usage
>By default, the proxy doesn't run as a daemon

- Using Screen\
Run the proxy inside a UNIX Screen, so that you can let it run in the background.

- Using systemd service\
~Coming Soon!~ DIY

- Inside a docker container\
Please refer to the [`Docker`](#docker) installation steps for the same. For managing the image on a remote server, I recommend using [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)

## Advanced
To run it as a daemon, add:
```json
"daemon": "True"
```
in `options` dict in `reverse-proxy/__main__.py:main`

> This repo might look like a reverse-proxy for a particular web address, but it is to show an example of how different end-points which may return different type of responses should be handled.

> To better understand how Redis caching can be enabled/used for certain end-points, please refer to the implementation of the `/help` end-point

## Release notes
`0.6.0`
```md
- Bug fix: Sorting on a user's torrent page works now (better handling of Query parameters in httpx requests)
- Formatting changes with Python Black
- Additional type safety
```

## Future plans
- ~Dockerize for OS-agnostic run~ Done
- Improve how the number of workers is set
- Make a non-Redis version/Redis decorator with a bool switch
